<h2>Ming Na Wen
Occupation: Amazon Middle management- has sights set on executive team, evening MBA  @UW Foster
Age: 29 </h2>
<p>
Travels between neighborhoods to save money and go over logistics of job and school inbetween work, home and school. As she is moving up in her company- she is getting sent overseas more and needs more unique but not useless gifts. She is so strapped for time that she is ok with spending a little more to get the right gift. Time is her most precious resource.
A day in her life: Wakes up at 5, does a little yoga, eats breakfast. </p>
<p>
At breakfast time she is already checking her emails and planning a new to-do list based on what is going on. She may or may not have slept even 5 hours. She has developed a strong dependency on caffeine. By 6:30am she has already left for work. While she commutes, she starts reviewing notes from meetings and messaging other employees to get her agile workday started.
She is at work by 7:15, has already checked in with her team and is planning the morning meetup for them to assess exactly what is happening- and whether they are on schedule. This goes until 8am.
</p>
<p>All the meanwhile- she is constantly checking her phone- and trying to get tasks either off of her plate or reassigned. At 8am she finally gets to sit at her desk for more than 5 minutes. This doesn’t last long. The rest of her day is spent going between engineering and development teams to make sure everything stays on track and to lend any assistance if there are any hiccups. At lunch she takes a brief walk before sitting down to study for class.
</p>
<p>On the bus to class after work- it’s one of her only chances to relax. She often eats dinner on the bus and gazes out the window. However, being a workaholic, she usually starts reading either the news on her phone or shopping online.</p>

<h2>Name: Jim Hoskins
Age: 23
Occupation: Musician/Barista </h2>
<p> Jim just graduated from Cornish and splits his time between working the opening shift at his local coffee house and making it to band practice. He doesn’t have time at work or band practice to surf the internet or shop. His schedule can be erratic. He tries to limit gigs to Friday and Saturday nights, so he can maintain a steady work schedule. However because of the ever changing show times- he sometimes goes to work on 1-2 hours of sleep, finishes work, goes home- passes out for 2 hours- and then leaves for band practice. His band has a big gig coming up and a meeting with record executives. He wants to find something unique but not too expensive since he is on a limited budget. However if there is something really amazing, he will be willing to spend a little more than planned since he is always on the go and needs to order deliveries. </p>

<h2> Name: Bob Rawlins
Occupation: Retired, professional grandpa
Age: 68 </h2>
<p> Long now a widow, he travels from Beacon Hill to Federal way to help take care of his grandkids while his daughter goes to work. He lives modestly, so none of his relatives will take advantage of him. He does like to offer the occasional indulgent big gift to a family member or two. He wishes he could either hire a service to help his daughter- or to make his life more convenient. His hands have arthritis and he no longer has the same dexterity of his youth. When making food- he is often limited to preparing simple sandwiches- because his hands can’t grip a can opener.
His day usually starts at 7am when he wakes, prepares breakfast and then takes the bus to babysit his grandchildren. He enjoys playing with his smart phone when they sleep. Although his hands have issues, he takes pride in his ability to adapt to new technology as a senior citizen.

<h2> Name: Juanita Martinez
Age: 37
Occupation: Mother, paralegal </h2>
<p>Juanita’s life has recently calmed down since she has a new job in Captiol Hill. She lives in Beacon hill, and has 2 children. Since they are now both in Jr. High, she doesn’t have to spend too much time doting on them. With the new lightrail addition, her commute has become much faster and easier. However, she needs to visit the other lawfirm’s branch 2-3 times a week. Always wanting to save money she takes the bus. Due to the nature of her work, she has a work and personal smart phone. Not wanting to get in trouble or draw any attention to herself she keeps these hidden during her bus trips. Most of the time she relaxes or fidgets. She misses old print media. One of her weekly highlights is picking up new issues of the stranger. She loves this because it’s not on a screen and she has something to read during her ride. The end of the year is fast approaching and she needs to not only find a gift for her boss- but she needs to recommend what he should give all of the lawyers in the firm. She misses old print catalogs. Since it’s not her bank account money is not much of an issue- it really comes down to time. </p>


<h2>Nishant Takuri
Occupation: Engineering manager, Microsoft
Age: 43 </h2>
<p> Nishant is in town on a business trip. He wants to bring back unique American presents for his family in Singapore and extended relatives in India. He is budget conscious- but is willing to bend if it’s truly amazing. All of this last major purchases were tech related. He loves gadgets and gizmos that make life easier, i.e. cooking. He doesn’t want to go too overboard, because then he’ll get in trouble with his wife when he gets home. He travels to Seattle, once a quarter and usually stays about 2 weeks. To save money- he always takes the bus. Seattle is kinda dirty compared to Singapore so he never touches anything on the bus. He enjoys reading Seattle newspapers and weeklies. On routes to the Eastside, he has been happy because everything is clean. He has learned to avoid certain neighborhoods because the trash drives him nuts. </p>
